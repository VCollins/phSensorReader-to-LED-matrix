# phSensorReader-to-LED-matrix
A Python-based program to read data from an analog pH sensor and disply it on a LED matrix display unit.

The pH sensor device is provided by DFRobot (https://community.dfrobot.com/makelog-308045.html) but this is a personal project, no commercial sponsorship or any endorsements apply. This project is also not intended to be used as a market product, but rather as a proof of concept.

I would also like to thank Richard Hull and other contributors for making the MAX7219 LED matrix driver available at https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix
